# ResFall
Residual Network-based Supervised Learning of Remotely Sensed Fall Incidents using Ultra-wideband Radar

We propose a fall detection in human daily activities using an ultra wideband
radar. A time series derived from the radar scattering matrix is used as input to the the residual
network for automatic feature extraction.
